Hello World,

Thanks for checking out my website. My name is Krishna Sangeeth, I am currently working as a Data Scientist as part of the Global AI Accelerator 
group in Ericsson. Prior to Ericsson I have worked on solving the large scale hierarchial classification problem at Indix and Data Fusion problem
for Nielsen. I have also had a run in with many diverse engineering problems at TCS ranging from legacy systems such as Mainframes, Fortran to Bigdata
systems like Spark, Hadoop etc. Over my career, my philosophy towards work has been to be passionate and eager about learning something and keep
getting better at my skills.
 
I care deeply about building robust ML Software products that bring value to the business and work in production. I am specifically interested in 
Nature Language Processing (NLP) as a subfield where i have done most of my work. I am also interested in distributed systems and building scalable
solutions. Not a fan boy of any particular technology stack, but i do tend to use Python for getting most of the things done.

I am an open-source enthusiast with successful code contributions made to projects such as scikit-learn, mlflow etc. I am not very active lately, but  
you can see some of my opensource work [here](https://github.com/whiletruelearn). 

The best way to connect with me is via [twitter](https://twitter.com/whiletruelearn) , i typically post my rants about life, universe and everything else there.

On a personal front I am married and I enjoy traveling, reading, watching movies, listening to podcasts, etc
