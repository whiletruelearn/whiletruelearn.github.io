<h1>Hello World!</h1>



<p>
Thanks for checking out my website. My name is <b>Krishna Sangeeth</b>, I am currently working as a Data Scientist in the Global AI Accelerator 
group of Ericsson. Prior to Ericsson I have worked on solving  large scale hierarchial classification  at Indix and Data Fusion 
for Nielsen. I have also had a run in with many diverse engineering problems at TCS  working on things ranging from legacy systems such as Mainframes, Fortran to Bigdata
systems like Spark, Hadoop etc. Over my career, my philosophy towards work has been to be passionate and eager about learning something everyday and keep
getting better at my skills, hence my handle across the web <b>whiletruelearn</b>.

</p>
<p>    
I care deeply about building software, specifically about building software systems where there is  intersection of <b>Distributed systems</b> and <b>Artificial Intelligence</b>.
Not really a fan boy of any particular technology stack , but i do tend to use Python for getting most of the things done.
</p>
<p>
I am an <b>open-source</b> enthusiast with successful code contributions made to projects such as scikit-learn, mlflow etc. I am not very active lately, but  
you can see some of my opensource work <a href="https://github.com/whiletruelearn"> here</a>
</p>
<p>
The best way to connect with me is via <a href="https://twitter.com/whiletruelearn"> twitter</a> , i typically post my rants about life, universe and everything else there.
On a personal front I am married and I enjoy traveling, reading, watching movies, listening to podcasts, etc
