<h1>Hello World!</h1>



<p>
Thanks for checking out my website. My name is <b>Krishna Sangeeth</b>, I am a <b>Machine Learning engineer</b>  from Kerala, India. 

I have been working as a freelance engineer/consultant for the past year or so. Below is my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/whiletruelearn"> career highlights </a> so far. 

<ul>
    <li>Machine Learning Lead @ Avalara</li>
    <li>Senior Data Scientist @ Ericsson</li>
    <li>ML Engineer @ Indix</li>
    <li>Software Engineer @ TCS</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
I hold a Master's degree in Datascience and Engineering from BITS Pilani and a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science Engineering from 
College of Engineering Chengannur.
</p>

I am a very curious person in general about the world and how stuff works. Some of this curiosity has made me decently good at building software. 
I try and fail most days to embody the virtues <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stoicism"> Stoicism. </a>
I usually post my rants about life, universe and everything else in <a href="https://x.com/whiletruelearn"> Twitter </a>. </p>
