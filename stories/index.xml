Amidst such chaos , you seem to be lost somewhere, somewhere that is clearly not the present.

I had this idea in my head of creating a short film of sorts and the story kind of became a bit like screenplay. Anyways this got published in the college magazine and my dear editor/ director friend Anuraj did promise me that he will convert this story to a short film one day. I am still waiting for that day :-D</description></item></channel></rss>
